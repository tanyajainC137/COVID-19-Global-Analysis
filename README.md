# COVID 19 GLOBAL Analysis

> This is part of an internship project.

> All resources used are opensource.

[EDA1.ipynb](https://github.com/tanyajainC137/COVID-19-Global-Analysis/blob/master/EDA1.ipynb) is an extensive python notebook on data cleaning and visualization.

> Edit: I later created a dashboard of all the visuals obtained in this project. The dashboard is available [here](https://github.com/tanyajainC137/flask-dashboard)
